# practice-user-management-operations-Stacey-T

A file named sql-practice.sql containing all the SQL queries from this exercise. 
● Make sure all queries are commented and organized by task. 
● A brief README.md (2–3 sentences) describing what you practiced and what 
you found most challenging. 

I practiced using SQL DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT and other quires to make changes to users table. What I found the most challenging was using the correct syntax for each query.
